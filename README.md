# Sonic Minds

Presented by Lewisham Music, Sonic Minds is a two-year creative music project working with care-experienced children and displaced young people. 

Original music and spoken word created by the young people captures their stories, experiences, hopes and ambitions. Sound designer and artist Gawain Hewitt created an interactive sound installation, cast in pewter that celebrates the unknowable creativity of the brain. It advocates for the project participants to allow their music and sounds to be elevated and celebrated.

Journey through the young people’s music by touching different parts of the brain sculpture. With each touch you will discover a new young person’s music and story.
